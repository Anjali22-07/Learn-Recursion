# 🧮 Recursion in DSA – Concepts, Code, and Practice

This repository is my personal collection of **recursion-based problems** in Java, built as part of my DSA learning journey. From basic recursion techniques to more complex backtracking problems, each file here is implemented with clean code and meaningful comments to make understanding easier.

## 📌 What is Recursion?

Recursion is a method where a function calls itself to solve smaller parts of a bigger problem.  
It's not just about repeating calls — it's about solving problems that have a natural substructure, like trees, permutations, and puzzles.

## ✨ Why This Matters

Recursion is at the heart of many interview questions and real-world algorithms — like tree traversal, graph DFS, and backtracking problems.  
By working through these problems manually, I’m not just learning syntax — I’m building logic, confidence, and problem-solving patterns that apply to more advanced topics in DSA.
